# A Whirlwind Tour of Python

The main repository for this project is:

    https://tfwebdev.research.cchmc.org/ern6xv/whirlwind-tour-of-python.git

## Slides

Slides from the "Python: a quick introduction" presentation (created using
[reveal.js][revealjs]) may be found in the `slides` subdirectory of this
repository, and may also be viewed online [here][] (FIXME).

### What you'll need to get started

**FIXME**

* Git (FIXME: maybe also a GUI like Syntevo SmartGit)
* a code editor like [Atom] or [Sublime Text][st]; _Windows' Notepad or OS X's
  TextEdit.app are_ not _suitable for this activity_

Decide on a nice home for your copy of the project. (Git calls this
a "clone"). I like putting projects in a folder called "devel" in my home
directory (`$HOME/devel` on Unix or OS X, `C:\Users\YourName\devel` on
Windows).

Then:

```bash
cd /to/the/place/where/you/do/dev/stuff

# replace `usr0xy` with your actual CCHMC username
git clone https://usr0xy@tfwebdev.research.cchmc.org/ern6xv/whirlwind-tour-of-python.git
```
